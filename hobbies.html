        <ol class="one">
          <li><strong>Book reading:</strong></li>
          <p>I read books for gaining information and clearing my mind. I strongly believe that everyone should read atleast 10 minutes daily &#128218; (everyone, no matter how busy, can take out 10 minutes from 24 hours).</p>
          <li><strong>Video editing (self taught):</strong></li>
          <p>Video editing is a very fun skill that i enjoy. I can do basic video editing, but i also push my editing skills if i want to with the help of youtube and editing documentation given by the editing software &#128516;</p>
          <li><strong>Basic Photoshop Editing (self taught):</strong></li>
          <p>Its difficult to decide if i love video editing or photoshop editing. personally I love and enjoy both the skills and choosing between them would be like choosing a favourite child. The Image of mine that you saw on home page was photoshopped by me &#128187;</p>
          <li><strong>Trading/Investing (self taught):</strong></li>
          <p>I like the idea behind Investing: owning a part of a company that you are confident that it will perform well in future. Its a time taking process and requires some pre-requisites before you can make some good investment decisions &#128200;. This is where book reading comes in handy &#128515;</p>
          <li><strong>Web Development (currently learning):</strong></li>
          <p>Currently I am learning Web development. This website (yes, the one you are reading right now) is made by me with my newly acquired Web Development Skills &#127760;.</p>
